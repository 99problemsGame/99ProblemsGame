Making the Cards
---------------

-   Print the latest version of the PDF on 8.5x11 sheets of card stock paper. A heavy weight paper will increase the durability and improve game play and card shuffling. *Optional* print pure red on one side of the paper for back of 'problem' cards.

Play the Game
---------------

In a similar style to cards against humanity and apples to apples. The game has multiple rounds for each player to take a turn going first. But here, the cards played are not anonymous, instead they are explained and provided justification and fruitful conversation.

To Start, deal the cards ~ 11 white solution cards per person. Create a stack of problem cards, turn one over to start the round. The person who did not want to play the game the most, the player on their left plays the first solution card and game continues clockwise from there.

First, each player uses a best guess solution white “solution” card combined with creativity to solve the current red problem card.

-   Example 1: if the problem was not having any friends one of the solution cards you might have would be volunteer. The explanation could likely be that volunteering allows you to meet others over a common activity and can bond and possibly create a friendship.
-   Example 2: if the problem is Manatees being injured by boats, one possible solution card might be triangulation. The explanation could be that by using triangulation the manatees can be located (using radio or GPS) and signaled to boaters to avoid those areas.

Second, each player takes turns sharing their best solution card combined with their idea on how it can be applied to the solution. The group votes on the best solution to the problem after all players have had a turn. Any discussion or conversation is encouraged to discuss the problems and possible solutions. The ⅗ majority voted winner gets to keep the red card as a point. The Game ends when all the world's problems have been solved.

### Optional Variations

-   Try combining previous solutions played by others in the same round, you can obtain bonus points for thinking of a solution that is more practical and uses more solution cards.
